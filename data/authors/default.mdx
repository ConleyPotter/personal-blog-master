I'm a seasoned marketing technology leader with over 7 years of experience in digital transformation and business growth. I've had the pleasure of working with a variety of organizations, from small businesses to large corporations, helping them leverage innovative marketing strategies and advanced tech solutions to achieve their goals.

My expertise lies in leading cross-functional teams and optimizing customer experiences through marketing automation and CRM integrations. I'm passionate about using data-driven insights to future-proof marketing operations and drive measurable results.

In my previous role as Director of Marketing Technology at Stoltzfus Structures, Horizon Structures, I led the technical marketing strategy and managed the development team, implementing modern tech stack solutions to improve marketing efficiency and customer experience. I also spearheaded digital transformation initiatives, like migrating websites to a modern tech stack, which dramatically improved site performance and best practices.

Before that, I served as Manager of Tenfold’s Financial Empowerment Center, where I helped individuals and families achieve financial stability by leading 12 staff members to exceed targets and deliver exceptional results, boosting funding efficiency and optimizing service delivery through data-driven strategies and team leadership. 

I also have many years of experience working as a freelance digital marketing director and web developer, providing my clients with a wide range of services, including SEO consulting, content strategy, email marketing, and PPC marketing automation. 

I'm a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese and English Literature. I went through a rigorous coding bootcamp, App Academy’s Full Stack Web Development certification program.

When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking along the Susquehanna River and my local sections of the Appalachian Trail, spending time with my family and friends, travelling around the world to practice my language skills, and reading works of classic fiction. I'm also an active volunteer in my community, and I dedicate much of my free time in this way.
